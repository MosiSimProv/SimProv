SimProv
=======

SimProv is a practical solution for capturing provenance information of simulation studies.
The software ensures a clear separation of concerns between provenance capturers, responsible for gathering information from various software systems used in the modeling process, and a provenance builder, which extracts and organizes this information into a provenance graph.

Features
--------
- Automated Provenance Capture: Simprov automates the collection of provenance information by integrating with various software systems commonly used in simulation studies.
- Provenance Graph Generation: Using a client-server architecture, Simprov constructs a provenance graph that visually represents the relationships between entities, activities, and contributors involved in the simulation study.
- Rule-Based Processing: The software employs rule-based processing to extract relevant information from collected data and generate a comprehensive provenance graph.
- Web Interface: Simprov provides a user-friendly web interface for exploring the captured provenance graph, enabling researchers to visualize and analyze the history of their simulation studies.
- Integration Support: Simprov supports integration with existing simulation tools and workflows, making it easy to incorporate automated provenance capture into research practices.
